# WIDEBOT - 2023 Internship

This repository contains completed tasks for the WIDEBOT - 2023 Internship AI assignment. The tasks involved a spelling checker, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and text classification using a machine learning-based classifier.

## Task 1 - Spelling Checker

### Description
In this task, I implemented a spell checker class that utilizes a given dictionary to perform various operations.

### Completed Operations
1. **Stored Dictionary:** The dictionary was stored in a suitable data structure to ensure efficient spell-checking operations.

2. **Find Nearest Words:** Given an input word, the spell checker returns the nearest 4 words if the word is not in the dictionary. The "nearest 4 words" are determined as the two words before and after the input word in lexicographic order if they exist in the dictionary.

3. **Add Word to Dictionary:** I implemented the functionality to add a new word to the dictionary.


## Task 2 - EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

### Description
In this task, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the provided dataset containing stories data from Hespress.

### Insights Explored
1. Count the Number of Examples per Class.
2. Top Frequent 2-grams Generally and per Class.
3. Lengths of Examples in Words and Letters.
4. Most Prolific Authors.
5. Dates of Publication.

### PDF Report
I prepared an EDA report in PDF format showcasing the insights gained from the data. The report includes descriptions, tables, charts, and visualizations to present the findings effectively.

## Task 3 - Classification

### Description
In this task, I built a machine learning-based classifier using the dataset from Task 2 and evaluated its performance on the test-set.

### Results
I present the precision, recall, f-score, and accuracy for each class and the entire test data.

### Enhancements
As a potential improvement, I have provided some suggestions for enhancing the classifier's performance.
